          We bring together New Zealand's top consultants to work with businesses
          who want to innovate, and differentiate their product or service. We
          bring in NZ's very best service designers, interaction designers, user
          experience researchers, business analysts, strategists, agile coaches,
          and change managers. People who know how to deliver successful service
          design projects that transform businesses.
        </p>

        <p>
          Prior to we, Leanne worked as an independent consultant who transformed
          public services and improved customer experiences in the UK, USA,

        <h2>What do <span class='logo'>we</span> do?</h2>

        <p>
          We re-design services, improve customer experiences, and show
          organisations how to make the most of their creative intelligence.
          Sharpen your thinking tools.
        </p>

        <dl>
          <dt>Experience research</dt>
          <dd>
            Together we will uncover how customers experience your product or
            service through ethnographic research and usability testing. We will
            challenge your assumptions about what customers need, help you see the
            big issues, and spy opportunities for you to be different.
          </dd>

          <dt>Insight &amp; storytelling</dt>
          <dd>
            We will help you tell a compelling story about your customer journey
            to the rest of your organisation. Hear their voice in video, personas,
            user journeys, and keynote presentations.
          </dd>

          <dt>Service design strategy</dt>
          <dd>
            We love future thinking. We will co-create a shared vision of what
            success looks like. Then we will figure out how to get there.
          </dd>

          <dt>Co-design workshop facilitation</dt>
          <dd>
            We bring people together to design better products and services. We
            invite staff and customers to put on their creative thinking hats and
            solve your toughest problems. Then make prototypes that put their
            ideas to the test.
          </dd>

          <dt>Digital experience design</dt>
          <dd>
            We re-design the non- human aspects of your service. We can support
            with interaction design, information architecture, and visual UI
            design for customer facing digital channels.
          </dd>

          <dt>User testing</dt>
          <dd>
            We test prototypes in the real world with users and finesse service
            concepts to better meet their needs.
          </dd>

          <dt>Education in design thinking</dt>
          <dd>
            We build internal capability. We inspire teams to approach problems
            more creatively and collaboratively. We will exercise your creative
            mind and leave you with new design thinking tools that can be used
            across your business.
          </dd>

          <dt>Change by design</dt>
          <dd>
            We transform culture within organisations. We help teams become human
            centred, super collaborators, and exceptional problem solvers. We will
            support you in embedding design thinking through carefully considered
            change management.

        <h2>Service design <span class='logo'>101</span></h2>

        <p>
          Service design is about making your service more useful, usable, desirable, and efficient. We consider all possible interactions between customers and your service. Human, physical, and digital. We ask: how might we enhance your customer’s end-to-end experience? Then we turn our thinking towards your operations. We ask: how can we optimise how people, processes, and technologies work together to deliver your service?
        </p>

        <p>
          More often than not, this leads us to get out of the office and talk to the public about using your service. Experience research fosters a deeper understanding of your customer’s needs and their challenges. Spot opportunities to add service value and to reduce your cost to serve.
        </p>

        <p>
          Armed with user insights and a better understanding of your challenges, together we will re-imagine your service and explore new approaches to delivery. We use a co-design approach that empowers service delivery teams to explore new service solutions, prototype their ideas, and test these out with customers.

        <h2>Design <span class='logo'>thinking</span></h2>

        <p>
          We follow a design led approach that focuses on unveiling actionable insights, and creating new service solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          When the first diamond begins to open, we open our mind to exploring the assumed problem. When the diamond begins to close back down, we start to make sense of our insights to pinpoint the real problem.
        </p>

        <p>
          When we enter the second diamond we start to focus on finding a solution to the problem(s) identified. But, it is only after brainstorming all possible solutions, that we begin to focus on defining and refining any one solution.
        </p>

        <p>
          This deliberate convergent and divergent thinking is known as ‘design thinking’.
